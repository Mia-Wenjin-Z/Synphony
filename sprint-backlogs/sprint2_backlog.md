## Fix sprint 1 bugs!

0. Mia & Nichole: **SEARCH API BROKENÔºÅ**

1. Alan - **sign-up page format & redirection (don't hard code it)**

2. All - Merged code still not working

   \- Nichole (play songs not working for existing songs)

   \- Mia (Add songs totally not working)

3. All - Create multiple studio? (**cannot have 2 active studio at same time**), related to closing studio & some checking logic

4. Alan - Must select a song to add upon creating studio

5. Alan - Why can we select a host upon creating studio? (**We can only create studios of ourselves)**
