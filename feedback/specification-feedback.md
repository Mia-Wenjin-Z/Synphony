# Project Specification Feedback

Commit graded:Â 30f492b086a7a6fe7fe2a3314eeacc29ef6ab118

### The product backlog (10/10)
### Data models (10/10)

-0, Your models are generally complete and adequate, but I believe you can have a better model relationship among Syner, Participant and User.

### Wireframes or mock-ups (10/10)
### Additional Information

-0, Ideally you should not modify your commit to sprint backlog (which is for grading) after the specification due. In order to reflect your progress, you can commit the modification to a different branch and merge it back after the grading.
