Feedback

Based on your Sprint 2 presentation, we have the following feedback for your team: 
* Your web application is nice, and it is good to see you successfully applied WebSocket to implement your functionalities. I am also happy with the UI design. The only concern I have now is about your deployment. WebSocket is a lot harder to deal with in cloud than locally, so you should deploy your app ASAP. If you find AWS or Azure is hard to use, try Digital Ocean or Heroku instead. Other suggestions to your video demo: you don't have to logout to allow another user to register and login. You can simply open a incognito window in Chrome or even a new window in Safari to separate the sessions. This is more realistic to your demo and easier for audience to understand. Also next time you might want to turn down the music a little bit since sometimes I couldn't hear what you are talking about while the song is played.

Additionally, we have the following feedback for all the class. You may find that some of this doesn't apply to your team, but please consider it as you plan for your final presentation. 
*  If you did not deploy in Sprint 2, you should prioritize deployment as soon as possible. 
*  You should ensure that your site is robust.  During the final presentation, your site should be as robust as possible. You should prioritize robustness over adding new features at this point.
*  We will be doing code review on your project during the final presentation.  You should ensure you are correctly validating any inputs in for your site.
